The structure to the page for retreiving recipe information was borrowed from

https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript/

and the general shape of the page was inspired from 

https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_column_cards.asp

while a lot of inspiration was taken from these two pages, the majority of the content is from me

I also added a "dark mode" for the site as that was leftover from a previous project I worked on and found it a pleasantly simple addition

It is known that sometimes the console outputs an error involving whether or not the hover display should be on when going from generally over a card to over a button, however this does not seem to cause any internal errors nor impact the overall experience of using the site
